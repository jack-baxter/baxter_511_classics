Dataset: midi_classic_music

Project Summary: 
This project aims to classify classical music composers using deep learning models. The dataset consists of MIDI files from four composers—Bach, Beethoven, Chopin, and Mozart—sourced from the "midi_classic_music" dataset on Kaggle. 
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models are implemented to predict the composer of a given MIDI file based on its piano roll representation.

The project processes MIDI files into piano rolls, trains CNN and LSTM models, and evaluates their performance classifying each file by composers. 
The code is written in Python and utilizes libraries such as pretty_midi, pandas, numpy, tensorflow, and scikit-learn.
The script was constructed and run in Google CoLab coding environment.

Model Architecture:

Two deep learning models are implemented for composer classification:
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN):
Input Shape: (128, 4000, 1) (piano roll with an added  dimension)
Layers:
Conv2D (32 filters, 3x3 kernel, ReLU activation)
MaxPooling2D (2x2)
Conv2D (64 filters, 3x3 kernel, ReLU activation)
MaxPooling2D (2x2)
Flatten
Dense (128 units, ReLU activation)
Dropout (0.5)
Dense (4 units, softmax activation for 4 composers)
Optimizer: Adam
Loss: Categorical Crossentropy

Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Network:
Input Shape: (128, 4000) (piano roll w/o channel dimension)
Layers:
LSTM (128 units)
LSTM (64 units)
Dense (64 units, ReLU activation)
Dropout (0.5)
Dense (4 units, softmax activation)
Optimizer: Adam
Loss: Categorical Crossentropy
